Are you watching films? Have you always loved the way in which systems in films greet their users by calling their names? I bet that you too would like to know how to achieve similar results on your PC and welcome a computer.
You can make your system greet you in its computerized voice with this trick. You can say "Welcome to your PC, Username." to your Windows-based system.
Just simply press windows + R then type: shell:startup 
Then edit and save your welcome message in there.
That's it. Windows will welcome you the next time you start your machine. To see how it works, try it on your own. From my own knowledge, however, I can tell that this is a fantastic trick.
