Are you watching films? Have you always loved the way in which systems in films greet their users by calling their names? I bet that you too would like to know how to achieve similar results on your PC and welcome a computer.
You can make your system greet you in its computerized voice with this trick. You can say "Welcome to your PC, Username." to your Windows-based system.
To run it on Windows startup, you first need to build a VBScript containing the voice message and then place it in the Startup folder by just simply press windows + R then type: "shell:startup".
You need to open .vbs file with Notepad or any favorite editor like VS Code first to modify the VBScript. 
Then edit and save your welcome message in there or add anything.
That's it. Windows will welcome you the next time you start your machine. To see how it works, try it on your own. From my own knowledge, however, I can tell that this is a fantastic trick.
